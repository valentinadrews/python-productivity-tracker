Python Productivity Tracker
Description
A data-driven productivity management tool designed for freelance developers to optimize their workflow by monitoring biological and social metrics. This project focuses on the correlation between personal well-being (sleep cycles and social energy levels) and professional performance.

Key Features
Metric Logging: Tracks daily sleep hours and "social battery" levels to determine cognitive readiness.

Smart Suggestions: Dynamically categorizes productivity states as Optimal or Critical based on user-defined thresholds.

Data Persistence: Uses structured JSON storage for reliable history tracking and future analysis.

Safety Protocols: Includes built-in warnings to prevent "coding under burnout" when sleep metrics are critically low.

Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Data Format: JSON (for lightweight, portable database management)

Libraries: datetime, json

Roadmap
[ ] Integration of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

[ ] Automated weekly productivity reports.

[ ] API integration for external calendar syncing.
